            iPhone has a glass body. This is also the first iPhone that allows you to charge your phone wireless. The iPhone
             7 has a faster All processor. This chip is one of the most powerful and smartest chip in a smartphone at the time.

              ugraded the camera. This camera is wider then the cameras have been in the past.
              The next iPhone that was released was the iPhone X also known as the iPhone 10. This was on of the biggest chance
            in the iPhone that apple has made. With the iPhone X they changed the screen so there is no more white along
            the border of your phone. However Alpple changed something about the iPhone that some people did not like
            and that was they removed the home button. The iPhone X is all glass just like the 8. This iPhone also has face ID
